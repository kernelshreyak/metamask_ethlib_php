-----------------Metamask_ethlib Library
Library contains both JS and PHP code. 
The PHP file containing the library is metamask_ethlib.php.

It has following functions in the class(Metamask_PHP):
1. metamask_login(): this function allows login with metamask. 
This is still pending and will be updated once coding for this is complete.

2. metamask_sendTransacton(): this function calls web3js code to create a transaction from connected user's metamask
wallet. The receiever address and ETH amount is sent as parameters to this function. Also the success URL 
and error URL is passed as 3rd and 4th parameter respectively.

example :
$metamask = new Metamask_PHP();
$metamask->metamask_sendTransacton($address,$eth_amount,"https://bitbizsolutions.com/metamask_api/test.php?success=1",
            "https://bitbizsolutions.com/metamask_api/test.php?error=1");


 After transaction is done, it redirects to success URL with POST parameters 'txhash' as transaction hash and 
 'amount' as the ETH amount.

 In case error occurs or user cancels the transaction, it redirects to error URL.
